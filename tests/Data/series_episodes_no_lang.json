Daughter of famous surgeon Ellis Grey and currently recovering from a one-night stand. She shoos away her evening's companion, saying she'll be late for her first day of work. She is a first year intern at Seattle Grace Hospital and is working alongside some colorful characters. Cristina Yang is a highly competitive Stanford graduate who befriends Meredith. George O'Malley is a quirky warm hearted man who learns a lesson or two on his first day. Izzie Stevens is a former model who doesn't get any special treatment on her first day. And Alex Karev is an arrogant jerk who misdiagnoses a patient on his first shift. Overseeing them is Miranda Bailey, (not-so-) affectionately dubbed 'The Nazi'. Meredith also gets a surprise when she realizes that her friend from the night before is a co-worker, and even worse, her boss.","overviewTranslations":["ces","deu","eng","fin","fra","heb","hun","ita","pt","spa","tur","pol"],"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/episodes/73762/127738.jpg","imageType":11,"isMovie":0,"seasons":null,"number":1,"seasonNumber":1,"lastUpdated":"2022-10-15 18:07:21","finaleType":null,"year":"2005"},{"id":127739,"seriesId":73762,"name":"The First Cut Is the Deepest","aired":"2005-04-03","runtime":43,"nameTranslations":["ces","deu","eng","fin","fra","heb","hun","ita","pt","rus","spa","pol"],"overview":"The surgical staff tries to be optimistic as a young woman clings to life after a brutal attack.
